ASP.NET MVC + EF Assignment

This is an MVC web application built using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework. It demonstrates the use of the MVC design pattern, Code First migrations, database operations, form handling, and basic CRUD functionality.

Blackjack Game

This is a console-based C# application that simulates a Blackjack game. It uses classes, methods, loops, and conditional statements to mimic card dealing, player actions, and game outcomes based on standard Blackjack rules.

This project is an MVC web application that calculates insurance quotes based on user inputs and predefined business rules. It also includes an admin page where all submitted quotes can be viewed.
